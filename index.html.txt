Elapsed Roleplay – Official RP Rulebook (2025 Final Edition)
Introduction

Welcome to Elapsed Roleplay, a server built for immersive, realistic, and fair roleplay. This rulebook defines how players — including civilians, criminals, gangs, and law enforcement — interact, ensuring everyone has a fun, structured, and engaging experience. It also provides clear examples and explanations for each rule.

This guide is mandatory reading for all players. Ignorance of the rules does not exempt you from consequences.

1. General Rules
1.1 Respect & Conduct

Treat all players with respect at all times. No harassment, bullying, or discrimination.

Keep In-Character (IC) and Out-of-Character (OOC) separate.

Example of Good RP: You are robbed by another player. You comply IC and plan retaliation later through proper RP.

Example of Fail RP: You start insulting the robbers in OOC chat.

Do not spam chat, voice, or text commands to disrupt RP.

1.2 Cheating & Exploits

Any use of cheats, hacks, macros, or third-party tools is strictly prohibited.

Exploiting bugs for gain (money, weapons, items) will result in bans and wipe of affected accounts.

Good RP Example: You discover a bug that duplicates money and report it to admins.

Fail RP Example: You exploit a bug to duplicate money multiple times.

1.3 Admin & Staff Compliance

Follow instructions from staff immediately during RP.

Disputes or appeals must go through official ticket systems; do not argue IC or OOC during active situations.

2. Core RP Principles
2.1 Value of Life (VoL)

Every life matters. Do not act recklessly when threatened or outnumbered.

Good RP Example: You comply when three armed robbers hold you at gunpoint.

Fail RP Example: You pull a gun on five armed cops during a traffic stop.

2.2 Metagaming

Do not use OOC information for IC advantage.

Fail RP Example: Watching a live stream to track a player’s location in IC.

2.3 Powergaming

Do not force actions or outcomes on other players without giving them a chance to respond.

Fail RP Example: “I instantly knock you out” without allowing reaction.

2.4 New Life Rule (NLR)

After death, forget all events leading to that death.

Wait 15 minutes before returning to that location.

Fail RP Example: Returning immediately to exact revenge after respawn.
